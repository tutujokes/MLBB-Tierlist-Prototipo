# Project: Mobile Legends Tier List (API Integration Test)

This is a **simple static application** intended to test and learn how to use the **public MLBB Stats API** developed by [ridwaanhall](https://github.com/ridwaanhall).

## 🎯 Purpose

This project dynamically displays a **Tier List of Mobile Legends heroes**, using live data provided by the MLBB Stats API.

It's my **first attempt working with APIs**, done purely for learning purposes and personal growth.
